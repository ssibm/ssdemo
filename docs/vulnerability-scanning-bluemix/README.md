## IBM Cloud Container Registry - Scanning & Monitoring the Vulnerability of Images

---
This repository provides an overview and high-level instructions about Image scanning results inside a **namespace** using **IBM Cloud Container Registry Vulnerability Advisor** inside a [Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net) environment. 

These findings and instructions provided in this repository assume that the user has a [Bluemix account](https://console.bluemix.net), has completed the [setup instructions](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Registry/index.html#index) and **all** required CLIs as well as other prerequisites, already configured a [namespace](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Registry/index.html#registry_namespace_add) and is running [cluster(s)](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_tutorials.html#cs_cluster_tutorial) inside the Bluemix account.
